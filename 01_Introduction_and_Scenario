# Scenario - Lemonade - Cybersecurity Program

You've been hired to join the cybersecurity team at Lemonade, an online insurance company that covers everything from pets to laptops to homes. Lemonade has been in the process of having an external team develop a cybersecurity program to implement. Being a small company, Lemonade had no formal cybersecurity program in place until now.

Lemonade is seeking a comprehensive program tailored to their size and service offerings, particularly as they have launched an AI model to predict catastrophes and claims, using this data to price their policies. In this project, you will work closely with Nell Crain, CTO, and Rhea Ripley, CIO, to develop and implement the cybersecurity program.
