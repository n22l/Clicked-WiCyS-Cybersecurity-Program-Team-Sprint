# Scenario - Lemonade - Cybersecurity Program 🍋🔐

The #42 team has been hired to join the cybersecurity team at Lemonade, an online insurance company that covers everything from pets 🐾 to laptops 💻 to homes 🏠. Lemonade has been in the process of having an external team develop a cybersecurity program to implement. Being a small company, Lemonade had no formal cybersecurity program in place until now.

Lemonade is seeking a comprehensive program tailored to their size and service offerings, particularly as they have launched an AI model 🤖 to predict catastrophes and claims, using this data to price their policies. In this project, the #42 team will work closely with Nell Crain, CTO, and Rhea Ripley, CIO, to develop and implement the cybersecurity program. 🛡️📈
